A simple Spring Boot stack based application. I'm making this to learn Spring Boot and other Spring family frameworks.

### Working features:
* MySQL database(see SCHEMA.sql and DATA.sql)
* MySQL database connection
* Basic Spring Security is configured
* Registration
* Login and logout
* Password reset
* Password update
* Passwords are hashed using BCrypt(11 cycles, because why not),

### TODO:
* Two Factor Authentication(probably will use Twilio as provider),
* External login and register via OAUTH(Google and Facebook are primary targets),
* CRUD operations(yeah... I still haven't implemented this),
* Frontend React version
