#### A simple Spring Boot stack based application. I'm making this to learn Spring Boot and other Spring family frameworks.

### Implemented features:
* MySQL schema
* MySQL database connection via Spring JPA
* Spring Security form login
* Authentication, authorization and registration(BCrypt is used for hasing, 11 cycles)
* Password reset
* Password update
* External login via Google
* Basic domain CRUD operations
* Better errors display(right now errors are very poorly displayed to the user)

### Planned features:
* Frontend React version
* Full CRUD for necessary domain models.
* Internationalization
* Additional external login providers(Facebook, Github, etc.)
* Two Factor Authentication(my Twilio trial expired so I might not even bother, I'll see)

## Dear reader. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
