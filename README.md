###Working features:
* MySQL database(see SCHEMA.sql and DATA.sql)
* MySQL database connection
* Basic Spring Security is configured
* Registration
* Login and logout
* Password reset
* Password update
* Passwords are hashed using BCrypt(11 cycles, because why not),

###TODO:
* Two Factor Authentication(probably will use Twilio as provider),
* External login and register via OAUTH(Google and Facebook are primary targets),
* CRUD operations(yeah... I still haven't implemented this),
* Frontend React version

Dear reader. Let me know if you have any suggestions.
